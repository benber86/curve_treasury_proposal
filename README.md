# [Temp Check]: Start Building a Curve Treasury

### Summary

Curve's current treasury consists of $15m in CRV tokens. All protocol revenue is currently redistributed to LPs, veCRV and scrvUSD and there are no mechanism to grow the treasury. This is not sustainable in the middle to long term. Currently, the only way to cover the costs of maintaining and growing the protocol (payroll, audits, services, etc.) is by selling this limited amount of CRV. This proposal introduces two mechanisms to redirect a part of pool fees towards a protocol treasury. Feedback and suggestions are more than welcome.

### State of the Curve DAO Treasury

Curve has no formal treasury to speak of. The closest equivalent is the [community fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267), which was originally seeded with [151,515,151 CRV back in 2020](https://gov.curve.fi/t/scip-2-utilizing-the-community-fund/967). A part of this fund was later allocated to the grant council
