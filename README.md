# [Temp Check]: Start Building a Curve DAO Treasury

## Summary

Curve's current "treasury" consists of $16m in CRV tokens. All protocol revenue is currently redistributed to LPs, veCRV and scrvUSD and there are no mechanism to grow the treasury. This is not sustainable in the middle to long term. Currently, the only way to cover the costs of maintaining and growing the protocol (payroll, audits, services, etc.) is by selling this limited amount of CRV. The amount would only cover ~3 years of expenses at the current estimated burn rate. This proposal introduces two mechanisms to redirect a part of pool fees towards a protocol treasury. 

## State of the DAO's Finances

### Current Assets and Annual Expenditures

**The DAO has ~$16m in assets and spends ~$5m per year. It currently only has three years of runway.**

Curve has no formal treasury to speak of. The closest equivalent is the [community fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267), which was originally seeded with [151,515,151 CRV back in 2020](https://gov.curve.fi/t/scip-2-utilizing-the-community-fund/967). Later, 28 million CRV were allocated to the grant council ([here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/30) and [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd8162f097998153903c9a28c960de269deabae8b6497a7c9a3378b6f9e71c8ad)), 75.5 millions were spent to refund victims of the [re-entrancy hacks](https://hackmd.io/@vyperlang/HJUgNMhs2) ([here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/521) and [here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/593)), 21 million went to [Swiss Stake](https://gov.curve.fi/t/funding-proposal-for-swiss-stake-ag-the-company-building-curve/10204) to cover upcoming development ([here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/828)).

Of the original amount, 26 million CRV (USD $12m at current prices) remain in the community fund and 9 million (USD $4m) in the grants council multisig. The DAO needs to spend $4m per year to support development and audits via Swiss Stake. The costs of other service providers (such as Llama Risk) and grants bring the total to over $5m/y. Being entirely denominated in CRV, the treasury is exposed to the price risk of the CRV token. Selling assets will also put downward pressure on the price of the token. 

Yet while the situation requires urgent action, it is far from being critical.

### DAO Revenue

**The DAO has generated over $40m in revenue in 2024 and is on track to reach a similar amount in 2025. Basic operating costs only represent around 10% of this amount.**

While Curve's revenue fluctuates with the fortunes of the crypto market, the protocol generated over $40m in fees in 2024. Fees for the first two months of 2025 amount to ~$5.4m, which, with a crude projection, should get us above 35m this year. A typical startup's operating expenses account for 60 to 90% of revenue, for Curve it is only about 10%.

If the money is not used to cover the protocol's operating expenses, where does it all go? In short, veCRV. A baffling 70% of the DAO revenue is redirected towards governance token stakers:

This is capital that could be invested in development, security and marketing but instead goes to reward stakeholders who, since the rise of liquid wrappers, have no long term incentives to steward and grow the protocol. That is not to say that this capital provides no value to the protocol, but this situation is akin to using 70% of the revenue of a 4 year old company's to pay out dividends. Companies do not typically redistribute revenue in the early years of their lifecycle. If they do, the [median dividend payout ratio](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/divfund.html) for tech companies is around ~15%, 5 times less than what the DAO currently pays out. It's also worth noting that while early contributors to the protocol received a sizeable CRV allocation they could lock to receive yield, the composition of the core team and other contributors has almost entirely changed since the early days of the protocol. Almost none of the current contributors have a veCRV position sizeable enough to generate sustainable income from yield.
