# [Temp Check]: Start Building a Curve DAO Treasury

## Summary

Curve's current "treasury" consists of $16m in CRV tokens. All protocol revenue is currently redistributed to LPs, veCRV and scrvUSD and there are no mechanism to grow the treasury. This is not sustainable in the middle to long term. Currently, the only way to cover the costs of maintaining and growing the protocol (payroll, audits, services, etc.) is by selling this limited amount of CRV. The amount would only cover ~3 years of expenses at the current estimated burn rate. This proposal introduces two mechanisms to redirect a part of pool fees towards a protocol treasury. 

## State of the DAO's Finances

### Current Assets and Annual Expenditures

**The DAO has ~$16m in assets and spends ~$5m per year, i.e. it currently only has three years of runway.**

Curve has no formal treasury to speak of. The closest equivalent is the [community fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267), which was originally seeded with [151,515,151 CRV back in 2020](https://gov.curve.fi/t/scip-2-utilizing-the-community-fund/967). Later, 28 million CRV were allocated to the grant council ([here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/30) and [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd8162f097998153903c9a28c960de269deabae8b6497a7c9a3378b6f9e71c8ad)), 75.5 millions were spent to refund victims of the [re-entrancy hacks](https://hackmd.io/@vyperlang/HJUgNMhs2) ([here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/521) and [here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/593)), 21 million went to [Swiss Stake](https://gov.curve.fi/t/funding-proposal-for-swiss-stake-ag-the-company-building-curve/10204) to cover upcoming development ([here](https://curvemonitor.com/dao/proposal/ownership/828)).

Of the original amount, 26 million CRV (USD $12m at current prices) remain in the community fund and 9 million (USD $4m) in the grants council multisig. The DAO needs to spend $4m per year to support development and audits via Swiss Stake. The costs of other service providers (such as Llama Risk) and grants bring the total to over $5m/y. Being entirely denominated in CRV, the treasury is exposed to the price risk of the CRV token. Selling assets will also put downward pressure on the price of the token. Yet while the situation requires urgent action, it is far from being critical.
